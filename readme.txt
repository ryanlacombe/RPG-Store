Extra Notes:

* = Any input that isn't "1" will make the game advance without loading the files.
** = Due to how the inventories are set up, unless "All Items" is chosen the inventory will not be truly sorted. It will
	instead sort the items only for that instance. If "All Items" is chosen, however, the entire inventory will be sorted
	which will be reflected in all options that use it.
*** = Due to how the items are seperated, if "All Items" are chosen the item's stat will be displayed as "Stat" instead of
	the specific stat for the item.
